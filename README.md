# Pathpal - Progressive Web App

A simple Progressive Web App that displays "hello".

## Setup

1. Serve the files using a local web server (required for service workers to work):
   - **Python**: `python -m http.server 8000`
   - **Node.js**: `npx http-server`
   - **VS Code**: Use the "Live Server" extension

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

3. To install as a PWA:
   - In Chrome/Edge: Click the install icon in the address bar
   - On mobile: Use "Add to Home Screen"

## Note

You'll need to create icon files (`icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png`) for full PWA functionality. For now, the app will work without them, but you may see a warning in the browser console.
